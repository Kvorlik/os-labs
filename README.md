# os-labs
This repository contains laboratory work for the course "operating systems", relevant for 2019.

They are based on the works of students of previous years, which are contained in the .other folder, but refactored and adapted for 2019.

The lab_5 folder does not have a registry backup file with the .reg extension, because it is different for each computer. Also in this folder there is no empty folder "shared", for a task with shared access.
